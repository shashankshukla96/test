Central Code Repository

Before starting work => take code from repo => code changes => add code back in repo

Step 1: git pull => pull all the code from repo to your local project
Step 2: Code Changes ==> (whatever code changes you want)
Step 3: Commit code to git
Step 4: git push ==> whatever code you added, will not be copied to central code repo

git: is a tool/technology used for SCM: source code management

github: is a online platform which uses git, and it will provide central code repository.

# Initialise git locally: git init --> has to be done only once

# Stage changes to git: git add .

# Commit the code: git commit -m "Commit Message"

# Add remote: git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>  --> has to be done only once

# Push the code: git push <remote_name> <branch_name>


# Stages in GIT
1. Changes: After commit what are all the changes
2. Stage: Marking changes as staged, means that these staged changes are ready for commit
3. Commit: Final changes adding to the git.

remote: the central repository
git remote add abcd <remote_url>
