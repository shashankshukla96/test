Central Code Repository

Before starting work => take code from repo => code changes => add code back in repo

Step 1: git pull => pull all the code from repo to your local project
Step 2: Code Changes ==> (whatever code changes you want)
Step 3: Commit code to git
Step 4: git push ==> whatever code you added, will not be copied to central code repo

git: is a tool/technology used for SCM: source code management

github: is a online platform which uses git, and it will provide central code repository.

# Initialise git locally: git init
# Add changes to git: git add .
